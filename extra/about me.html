<p>Hello everyone! I am Yash Raj Mittal ,first year undergrad at IITK(Computer Science).I prepared for JEE ADVANCED for approx. three years.But thanks to god all the sacrifices didn't go in vain and i landed at IITK with a decent AIR. In the way of preparing for JEE i lost social contact.Coming at college would be helpful to make new friends but due to covid it is not possible as of now.
<br>I like to learn new things and as a step i have prepared this site as a assignment.I have also started coding which i found very fun.As of now i also made a place in Humanoid Robotics Team at IITK.I also like to play Badminton,Table Tennis,Cycling.</p>
